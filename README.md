# Unity3D-Test
Creating my first repos, experimenting with updating my test Unity 3D project on GitHub. (currebntly frozen)

What I want: use GitHub as some kind of version control of my test Unity 3D project; use GitHub as a back-up if something terribly wrong happens to the project (system hard drive fails, project is borked because of my terrible code etc.)
What would I do: update base Unity 3D project files to this repo, clone it and work on it, update it.
