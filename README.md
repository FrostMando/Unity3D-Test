# Unity3D-Test
Creating my first repos, experimenting with updating my test Unity 3D project on GitHub.

What I want: use GitHub as some kind of version control of my test Unity 3D project; use GitHub as a back-up if something terribly wrong happens to the project (system hard drive fails, project is borked because of my terrible code etc.)
What would I do: update base Unity 3D project files to this repo, clone it and work on it, update it.

If you read this: Hello there and have fun. You can comment, read and propose some things.

UPDATE: it's seems like making Git and Unity best friends is the pain the ass. I'm thinking I won't try to do it, for now.
CURRENTLY FROZEN.
